- [Introduction](#introduction)


## Introduction
Employers are continually seeking for methods to streamline their hiring procedures and find the best applicants for their organisations in today's fast-paced and ever-changing employment market. Our AI model makes use of the most recent developments in machine learning and natural language processing to analyse a candidate's personality traits, educational history, professional experience, and age and offer insightful information about their fit for a given post.
Employers may analyse a big pool of candidates fast and correctly using our AI model, and then decide who to invite for interviews or offer employment openings based on data. As the AI model employs objective criteria to evaluate each candidate, this not only saves time and money but also assures that the recruiting process is fair and impartial.
Our AI model, which was trained to find patterns and correlations between many elements that affect work performance, is based on a vast dataset of information about jobs. Our AI model can give you useful insights to help you reach your objectives, whether you're an employer trying to recruit the top applicants or a job seeker looking to find the ideal employment match.

## Problem Statement
1) The traditional hiring process is time-consuming and expensive, resulting in a slow hiring process and a higher hiring price.
2) Hiring is also a process that is subject to bias and inconsistency because recruiters are human with vulnerability and rely on subjective judgments.
3) During interviews, candidates may misrepresent themselves due to nervousness. It is therefore difficult for the recruiter to determine their true personality traits and characteristics.


## Objectives
1) To develop an A.I. Model to accurately predict job hiring based on personality test results
2) To reduce the time and cost associated with the hiring process by automating the personality testing and job hiring probability prediction process
3) To minimize the bias and inconsistencies in job recruitment process by using objectives measure of personality traits and characteristics.
